init.sh is a simple bash script to invoke edil.

When invoked, edil is built to its latest version and opens right up.

The script has several options:

 * -g  - Debug. This enables valgrind's memcheck tool.
 * -gg - Debug level 2. This displays all kinds of memory leaks, not
          just definite ones
 * -b  - Forces edil to rebuild.
 * -s  - Prevents logging stderr output of the program in a tmp file.
